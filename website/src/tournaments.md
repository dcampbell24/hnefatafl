## Tournaments

Play continues until a round in which there is only one player left or all
players got the same number of wins, losses, and draws in the last round. A
round is broken up into groups of at most eight players. Play within a group
consists of every player playing every other player once as the attacker
(black) and once as the defender (white).

The players are first sorted by rank with equally ranked players being sorted
randomly. Then the players are put into groups with highest rated players at
one end going down to the lowest rated player. The groups are arranged thusly
depending on the total number of players left:

5 4

5 5

6 5

6 6

7 6

7 7

8 7

8 8

6 6 5

...
```

After each round the winner of each group or all the winners in a group if tied
go on to play in the next round.
